# TO DOS
Whenever someone is replying to a message from Lupos, that has an image attached, ignore the text and only use the image prompt
Sometimes Lupos will mis-tag people: ie. @235195675707441155 vs <@235195675707441155>
Ability to see stickers
When asking to draw someone, put their name in the prompt, not the message author ?
Take response of what the image is, combine it for the response, as currently it doesn't 'see' what it draws
Make Lupos see itself when tagged twice
When replying to Lupos to "try again", generate prompt from the original message Lupos is replying to


Remove the word "draw" or replace with imagine
